# Wind Speed Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project aimed at predicting daily average wind speed. The core of the project is a Jupyter Notebook that explores, visualises, and models wind speed data over time, from January 2019 to September 2021.

## Features
- Data exploration of wind speed trends over two years
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualisation of daily wind speed data
- Predictive modeling using various machine learning algorithms and statistical methods
- Evaluation of model performance

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises daily wind speed measurements. It captures the fluctuations in wind speed over the course of the year 2019-2021.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install these packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
